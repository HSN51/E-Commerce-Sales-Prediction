## 🎯 Model Performance Comparison
| Model                  | MAE  | RMSE  | R2 Score |
|-----------------------|------|------|----------|
| *Linear Regression*  | 2163 | 2894 | 0.72     |
| *Random Forest*      | 1780 | 2492 | 0.79     |

*🎯 Best performing model: Random Forest with 79% accuracy!*

## 📤 Execution Steps
1️⃣ *Install Required Libraries*
bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


2️⃣ *Run the Notebook*
python
jupyter notebook ecommerce_sales_prediction.ipynb


3️⃣ *Use CSV Output for Power BI or Tableau*
python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("processed_ecommerce_data.csv")
df.head()


## 🎯 Conclusions & Future Improvements
✔ The Random Forest model provided the highest accuracy and can be further optimized using hyperparameter tuning.  
✔ Additional features such as seasonal analysis, promotional impact, and customer segmentation can enhance model performance.  
✔ Data visualization through business intelligence tools can provide deeper insights.
